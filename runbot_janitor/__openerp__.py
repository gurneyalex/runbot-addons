Runbot Janitor
==============

Aggressively clean filesystem databases and processes
Start a cron which will look in runbot's build directories
(runbot/static/build) and identify all build directories which have no running
builds (runbot.build).

Using the names of these directories, cleanup by:
  * killing processes which run executables in those directories or are
    connected to databases matching the directory names
  * drop all databases whose names match the directory names
  * delete the directory and its contents
